# salary-prediction-ensemble
project for salary prediction using ensemble learning ( extra tree regressor ) as part of IBM certification

This project predicts salaries using *Ensemble Learning (Extra Trees Regressor). It was built as part of the **IBM Machine Learning Certification*.

 Dataset Used
- *Salary_Data.csv*: Contains experience vs salary data.

Algorithm Used
- *Extra Trees Regressor* (an ensemble learning method that improves model accuracy and reduces overfitting).

Steps Followed
1. Data Loading & Cleaning  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Model Building using AutoAI  
4. Model Evaluation  
5. Deployment on IBM Cloud

 Deployment
- The model was deployed on IBM Cloud using *AutoAI* and *Cloud Object Storage*.
- Screenshots and reports are attached in the repo for reference.

 Files in this repository
- Salary Data.csv - Dataset  
- README.md - Project summary
